# Hypno: Evading the Catastrophic Forgetting Problem in Block I.I.D. Data with Sleep

In this project we propose an algorithm that attempts to mitigate the issue of catastrophic forgetting when learning on data that cyclicly changes distributions.

## Pre-requisites

Install the requirements with

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and by installing jax from https://github.com/google/jax#installation

## Just running the algorithm

To simply demonstrate the algorithm run the demo code with

```sh
python3 main.py
```

Optional commands and documentation can be found with

```sh
python3 main.py -h
```

## Seeing a Full Explanation

To see a full explanation of the code and some experiments open the `hypno.ipynb` file directly here in github (https://github.com/codymlewis/hypno/blob/main/hypno.ipynb) or locally with jupyter, note that in the latter case you will need to install jupyter from pip first.
